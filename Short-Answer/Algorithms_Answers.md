#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The runtime complexity is O(n) due to the fact that the outputs depends on value (n)


b) I believe the run time complexity is linear O(n) because iteration occurs relative to the input of (n). The while loop
is comparing value (n), but it is not performing an extra iteration, but if it did, the runtime would be quadratic O(n^2)


c) The runtime complexity for the third function is linear time O(n) because the output depends on the value of bunnies


## Exercise II
To determine at what floor would an egg break when dropped, I would star from the mid floor. Then, depending if the egg's
condition, I would elevate to the next floor or go down the next floor.
